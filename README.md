# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this challenge we were tasked to refactor the index.html and style.css files so that the code met accessibility requirements.
To do this I have:
- Cloned the initial repository onto my local computer
- Replaced the multiple div element tags that were in the index.html file with semantic tags.
- Removed any unnecessary classes from both files
- Updated the id of certain elements to allow navigation links to work
- Repositioned css attributes to follow the sequential order of the elements within index.html
- Updated css attributes to match the semantic tags that were swapped in on index.html
- Ensured the website maintained its original design/layout
- Updated the site title
- Added alt tag descriptions to all images
- Commited my changes to git with descriptions of what has changed
- Created my own repository for this challenge and pushed my changes to the repository
- Created a live page for the repository where the site can be hosted
